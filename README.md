### Main Idea :thought_balloon:
I came up with an app that would be able to bring party animals, to the coolest up and coming parties in the future. This said it will also have the opportunity for event owners to post their parties to up revenue off ticket purchases and footage through the gate.
After doing some much party planning over the years, I thought why not try make this part a little easier for everyone. It is a moblie phone application, that is essentially a party calender. From being able to view all up and coming parties, to being able to see all the fine details given by a specific party, want to leave a comment on a party dont worry you can, and a place to show if you're going to the party or interested.

I choose to a mobile app for 2 main reasons:
1. The convience of being able to pull out your phone and open the app and check anytime, any place.
2. This is a new technology practised, to be able to gain more knowledge in this area.

I also bet you are asking why **SKIT JOU BISCUIT?** In my home town of Cape Town, South Africa we had this saying, if it was a massive drop, or you just wanted to have a wiggle on the dance floor, we would all know with a simple, " **SKIT JOU BISCUIT!** "

### Planning:
Setting out the plan is always one of my favorite parts and for some reason always the place I feel like there is always sections to improve. I started with a rough plan of what I wanted to accomplish with my app. Please head on over to my [Google-Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jq708lVmd84ktend51X5nVAmS4AGvZFoXQ4kpyf_wIw/edit?usp=sharing) to see how I began my planning, and got the rough Data.

With the rough draft I had a good understanding of what data was going to be needed and what features I was going to try and implement. So I began with the Backend, and got a [dbDiagram](https://dbdiagram.io/d/5f54c1e988d052352cb61e8d), this shows a rough outline of how the tables are setup and how the relations are communicating between each other. I then setup my **Project Boards**, I started with my [Table Setup Board](https://github.com/DarianRushworth/SkitJouBiscuit-Backend/projects/1), that goes over instructions on setting up the Backend. Next was the [Router Implementation Board](https://github.com/DarianRushworth/SkitJouBiscuit-Backend/projects/1), which gives instructions on how I implemented the Routers throughout the Backend.

On completion of the Backend, I started with my **Frontend Boards**, I have created 2:
1. [Skeleton Setup](https://github.com/DarianRushworth/SkitJouBiscuit-Frontend/projects/1), this outlines the instructions that I took to setup the "Skeleton" of the app.
2. [Data Fetching](https://github.com/DarianRushworth/SkitJouBiscuit-Frontend/projects/2), thsese are the instructions I followed upon fetching data from the Backend.

I then came to the last phase of my planning, which was to use these **Frontend Boards** to come up with this

After all my planning I still could've thought a few aspects out earlier on, lessons to learn.
